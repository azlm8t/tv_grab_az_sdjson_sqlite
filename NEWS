User-visible and notable changes. For new options, see the README.md.

* 201810
- Prefer "poster" for fanart rather than wide art. This seems to be what media players prefer.

* 201809
- Database is automatically vacuumed every few months to improve performance.
- Database version upgraded. This allows us to lazily expire records, improving run time.
- Records are more lazily deleted from the database, reducing run time.
- New option "--no-channel-output" to avoid writing channel data to xmltv, saving PVR processing time.
- Support for caching generated data in Redis or files to improve run time. See README.md.
- New option "--cache-ignore-unchanged-programmes" to improve PVR processing time.
- Multiple lineups allowed in a single configuration file.
- New options "--channel-short-days-exclude-regex" and "--channel-short-days" to allow uninteresting channels to have shorter guide information, reducing PVR memory usage.
- New option "--benchmark" to log timing information for users.
- Artwork for long running shows and artwork that failed to download is automatically periodically refreshed.
- Additional script added for Tvheadend4.3+ (tv_meta_az_sd) for setting fanart on recordings. Place it in the same directory as "tvhmeta" and update the pre-processor command in Tvheadend to be "tvhmeta --uuid %U". The Tvheadend script will then use the tv_meta_az_sd to supply extra fanart to Kodi 18+.

* 201802
- New option "--update-description-with-all" (and others, see README.md) to put extra cast and rating information in the description. Useful for PVRs that don't display season/episode/rating information.
- Artwork downloaded for programmes.

* 201712
- New option "--merge-split" to merge programmes split by news. This avoids PVRs only recording the first half of programmes.
- Mark programmes as premiere. Note that some channels may mark the same episode as premiere multiple times, such as daytime and evening.
- Prefer tvdb season/episode numbers if available.
